            <p>In October 2014 I went on a trip to visit Zion National Park and hiked up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_Landing">Angel's Landing</a>
            while there.  The hike itself was challenging but worth it due to the spectacular views from the top of the rock formation.</p>

              <article>In October 2014 I went on a trip to Zion National Park with a friend to hike up the rock formation in the park that is called
                Angel's Landing.  We flew into Las Vegas drove up to St. George, Utah which is the nearest city to the park.  We stayed in town overnight
                and drove the next morning to the park.  On the way in we stopped in Springdale, Utah to eat breakfast before a day of hiking and exploring
                the park.  While we were eating and discussing what we would complete that day we spotted someone that looked familiar.  It turns out it was 
                the actor Jason Seagal (from "How I Met Your Mother" and "Forgetting Sarah Marshall").  My friend and I were suprised to see someone that famous there
                but decided against bothering him during his breakfast.

                We proceeded to go to the park, paying the fee required to get in, and parking.  Once parked we boarded the bus that would drop us off "near" Angel's Landing
                and began our hike after being dropped off.  The trail to get there was hilly and almost three miles long!  Part of the trail included steep switchbacks that wore me out.
                Once the trail to get there was done we were relieved, thinking we had completed most of the hike and that we just had to climb some on a rock near us to complete the hike.
                As it turns out we had only gotten to the start of the real trail.  The remaining part of the hike was a narrow trail that went over another rock formation and up Angel's Landing.
                At first I was nervous due to the heights and the fact that numerous sections required walking across a path that was roughly one person wide with a chain to hold onto.
                Looking down did not bring much relief and my nervousness almost got the better of me not far into the trip up.  Someone coming down told me it was worth it and to keep going so I continued
                the climb.  There was a lot of stopping and waiting for people coming back down the trail at sections that were too narrow for more than a single person to move through.
                Eventually we made it to the top and the view was amazing.  From the top you could see most of the Zion Canyon.  Looking and how far up I was gave me some perspective on how far we had hiked up during
                the climb.  After spending roughly 20 minutes at the top we began the trip down, which I found much easier than going up.  Eventually we made it back to the beginning of the trail and made our way back to our car
                and went back to St. George to relax after a long day of hiking.
